* Aspeed VGA shared memory driver

Aspeed VGA shared memory driver allow user to read data from AST2500
VGA memory. This driver is required by ManagedDataRegionlV2
specification. In the spec, BIOS will transfer whole SMBIOS table to
VGA memroy and BMC get the table from VGA memory. 0penBMC project do
not allow to use /dev/mem for security concerns. To get the data in
VGA shared memory in user space, implement this driver only allowed
user to mmap limited memory area.

Required properties:
- compatible: "aspeed,ast2500-vga-sharedmem"
	- aspeed,ast2500-vga-sharedmem: Aspeed AST2500 family
- reg: Should contain VGA shared memory start address and length

Example:
vga-shared-memory {
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-vga-sharedmem";
	reg = <0x9ff00000 0x100000>;
};
